# 🕹️UI-Plaground
 A collection of random, aesthetic, and multiple inspired UI designs — just for fun and creative practice.
Each mini-site lives here as its own small world 🌍

🎨 About
This repository is my personal web playground, where I experiment with different layouts, colors, fonts, and ideas — all made using simple HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

No heavy frameworks.
No complex backends.
Just pure frontend creativity.
